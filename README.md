# TodoApi

This is a small project API made in Elixir with Phoenix for managing TODO items.

To start the Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Make sure to update `username` and `password`configs in dev.exs file
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
